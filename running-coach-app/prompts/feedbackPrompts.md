# Running Coach Feedback Prompt Templates

## Recovery Feedback

### Novice
- "I notice you've been training hard lately. Your recovery score of {recoveryScore} suggests your body needs a break. Why don't we take an easy day to help you bounce back?"
- "As a newer runner, it's important to listen to your body. Your recent workouts show signs of fatigue - let's focus on rest and recovery today."

### Intermediate  
- "Your recovery metrics indicate you could use some downtime. Consider a recovery run at a truly easy pace ({targetPace} min/km) or cross-training today."
- "Based on your recovery score of {recoveryScore}, this would be a good time for active recovery. Keep the intensity low and focus on form."

### Advanced
- "Your recovery data suggests accumulated fatigue. To maintain your high training load, let's prioritize recovery with {recoveryActivity} today at {targetHeartRate} bpm."
- "Given your recent training intensity and recovery metrics, I recommend a recovery protocol: light movement, proper nutrition, and {recoveryTechnique}."

## Training Volume Feedback

### Novice
- "You're building consistency nicely! Adding just one more run this week would help you reach your goal of {weeklyRunTarget} runs."
- "Great progress on your running journey! To reach your weekly distance goal, try extending your next run by just 5-10 minutes."

### Intermediate
- "You're {distanceDeficit}km short of your weekly target. Consider adding some distance to your long run or splitting it across your remaining runs."
- "To hit your {weeklyRunTarget} runs target, let's find a good spot for one more quality session this week."

### Advanced
- "Your volume is trending {volumeTrend}% below your typical range. Here's a strategy to adjust your remaining sessions: {volumeStrategy}"
- "Based on your periodization plan, we should maintain {targetVolume}km this week. Here's how we can modify your remaining workouts: {volumeAdjustments}"

## Training Intensity Feedback

### Novice
- "Ready to try something new? Let's add some light pickups to your next run - just 30 seconds at a slightly faster pace, then back to easy running."
- "You're handling your easy runs well! Would you like to experiment with a basic interval workout? We'll keep it fun and manageable."

### Intermediate
- "Your training could use some variety. A tempo run at {tempoTargetPace} min/km for 20 minutes would be a great addition."
- "Looking at your recent runs, you're ready to include more quality work. Try this workout: {workoutDescription}"

### Advanced
- "To optimize your training stimulus, let's adjust your interval intensities to {targetPaces} based on your recent {racePace} race performance."
- "Your threshold sessions could be more specific. Target {thresholdPace} min/km for your next tempo blocks to align with your {raceGoal} goal."

## Pacing Feedback

### Novice
- "I notice your runs are all at similar speeds. Try slowing down on easy days - you should be able to hold a conversation comfortably."
- "Great enthusiasm! Remember that running slower on easy days (around {easyPaceTarget} min/km) helps build endurance safely."

### Intermediate
- "Your easy runs are trending too fast at {currentEasyPace} min/km. Aim for {targetEasyPace} min/km to better differentiate your training intensities."
- "To maximize your training benefits, let's create clearer separation between your easy runs and workout days. Here's your pace guidance: {paceGuidelines}"

### Advanced
- "Your aerobic runs are falling into the grey zone between easy and threshold pace. Let's polarize your training more effectively with these pace targets: {paceZones}"
- "Based on your recent {benchmarkWorkout}, here are your updated training paces for each workout type: {detailedPaceGuidelines}"
